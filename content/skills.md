My career has operated at the intersection of high-level strategy and low-level kernel analysis. I bridge the gap between "Business Risk" and "Packet Capture."

### [ rwx ] Core Competencies (Expert)
*Tools I use without checking the man page.*

* **SANS SIFT:** My default environment for forensic examinations.
* **X-Ways Forensics:** Deep experience in disk acquisition and artifact recovery.

### [ r-x ] Leadership & Strategy
* **SOC Management:** Built and led operations for a Fortune 1000 enterprise.
* **Incident Command:** Managed high-pressure incidents, coordinating technical response with executive communication.
* **Talent Development:** Mentoring analysts from "script kiddie" to senior threat hunters.

### [ -w- ] Initializing (Active Learning)
* **Cloud DevOps:** Translating traditional DFIR workflows into AWS/Azure pipelines.
