# Operational Capabilities

### The Doctrine
I believe in **forensic truth**. Tools are fallible; raw data is not. My approach to security is grounded in the command line, deep-dive artifact analysis, and the understanding that every adversary leaves a trace if you know how to look.

### Core Competencies
* **Advanced Incident Response:** Full-lifecycle management of high-severity breaches. I don't just alert on threats; I hunt, contain, and eradicate them.
* **Digital Forensics:** Expert-level analysis of disk images and memory. I prefer manual verification (hex editors, timeline analysis) over trusting a "magic button" tool.
* **Malware Analysis:** Reverse engineering malicious binaries to understand capabilities, C2 protocols, and intent.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Converting abstract indicators into actionable operational intelligence.

### The Toolkit
* **Forensics:** Plaso, EnCase, FTK, Volatility.
* **Terminal:** Bash, PowerShell, Vim (heavily customized for log parsing).
* **Infrastructure:** Windows Server Internals, RHEL/Debian, Cloud Security Architecture.

### Certification History
* **GREM** (Reverse Engineering Malware)
* **GCFA** (Forensic Analyst)
* **GCIH** (Incident Handler)
* **GCTI** (Cyber Threat Intelligence)
