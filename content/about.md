# Patrick Nikolas Jones

I am a cybersecurity veteran with over a decade in the trenches, specializing in **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**.

Most recently, I served as the **Head of Security Operations at RXO** (until May 2025), following a career trajectory that took me from Senior IR consultant at **Dell SecureWorks** to Principal Threat Hunter at **XPO Logistics**, followed by managing a SOC & DFIR team at **RXO**.

### The Mission
After years of managing teams and strategy, I am returning focus to the craft itself. Management taught me *how* to secure the business; the terminal is where I remember *why*.

This site is not a resume—it is a repository of tradecraft.
I built this platform to document:
* **Case Studies:** Breakdowns of incident types and robust investigative frameworks.
* **Methodology:** The "why" and "how" behind forensic artifacts, not just the tools used to find them.
* **Technical Rediscovery:** My journey re-sharpening the blade on cloud infrastructure and modern attack surfaces.

### /usr/bin/hobbies
When the monitors go dark, I disconnect:
* **Musician:** Classically trained cellist (almost made it a career).
* **Rider:** Taming a **Suzuki Hayabusa**.
* **Builder:** High-performance PC architecture & gaming (`apbowler5` on Steam).
